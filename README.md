# Python-Driven UI for Advanced SQL Database Operations

This project demonstrates how to build a complete, real-world application that combines a **MySQL backend** with a **Python (Streamlit) frontend**, allowing users to perform advanced SQL operations **without writing SQL manually**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Many non-technical users (managers, coordinators, team leads) need to work with database information, but they often don’t know SQL.  
This application provides a simple UI to help them:

- View and filter data  
- Run operations like updating stock  
- Check summaries and business reports  
- Perform calculations using stored functions  

Everything is done through a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🧱 How the Project Works

### Step 1: Build the MySQL Database

The backend includes:

- **Tables** for products, orders, shipments, and inventory  
- **Views** for summaries (e.g., product history, stock reports)  
- **Stored Procedures** for operations (e.g., mark order as received, update stock)  
- **Functions** for business logic (e.g., check if a product needs restocking)

This simulates how real businesses organize and automate data workflows.

### Step 2: Build the Streamlit Frontend

The frontend built with Streamlit allows users to:

- View data from tables and views  
- Run stored procedures using buttons  
- Insert/update records through forms  
- Execute MySQL functions directly from the UI  
- View instant results—no SQL queries needed

## ⭐ What Makes This Project Advanced

- Combines **backend SQL** with **frontend Python**  
- Teaches advanced MySQL concepts (views, triggers, functions, procedures)  
- Shows real-world inventory & operations system workflows  
- Demonstrates multi-layered application design  
- Creates tools usable by non-technical people
